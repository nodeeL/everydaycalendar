A Giertz inspired simple calendar, and a little php training all in one

This was put together in a few hours. Simone is inspirational and her product is fabulous.

I also need a little training in php, data management, html, css and so on.

Expect this to change massivly.

Currently all this needs is a php enabled webserver or engine. Be warned, it will create data files in the web directory,
so check your access rights if the config cannot be stored.

I will add some kind of ID system to it, so that you can use and store info on multiple tasks.
